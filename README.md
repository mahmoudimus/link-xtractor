# link-xtractor

A Google Chrome plugin that traverses all open tabs, targets a list of configurable hosts (set via options), and scrapes some metadata associated with them.

## Purpose

I needed a way to scrape some fields of specific sites and it was much easier to do it via Chrome's plugin system that writing a scraper in Python or something else.
