# link-xtractor

A Google Chrome plugin that traverses all open tabs, targets a list of configurable hosts (set via options), and scrapes some metadata associated with them.

## Code Quality

This is probably the worst project in terms of code quality that I have available. I've developed it a while ago and I decided to spruce it up for putting Github. So, obligatory, "THERE BE DRAGONS."

## Purpose

I needed a way to scrape some fields of specific sites and it was much easier to do it via Chrome's plugin system that writing a scraper in Python or something else.

## License

`link-xtractor` is a MIT/BSD/Apache2 triple-licensed library.
